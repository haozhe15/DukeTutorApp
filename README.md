# Description

Peer-to-peer tutoring has been shown to be one of the most effective ways for students to learn, but currently, there arenâ€™t many services that help facilitate this.  This peer tutoring mobile android app aims at Duke community and surrounding Durham community and helps match peer tutors with peer tutees at ease. 

When first using, one can log in using the Duke NetID or other social media account or create a new account. Then the software will collect the user's primary information, including identity, interested fields and available time.  After setting up, one can post a listing with a subject/time/location of a tutoring session or set up the filter to browse other tutors' offerings from the nearest ones. This app also has a payment system for the tutor to price their help. 

The tutee can directly contact the interested tutor via a private chat system. The tutor and tutee will discuss and decide the final time and location to meet.  When tutee quit the chat window, a window should pump up asking whether they have an agreement or not to keep track of history, as well as to offer information to the feedback system. Tutors and tutees can leave ratings and evaluations to each other. The tutor and tutee time will also be recorded and shown to others for reference.

The app is developed in Java language and released on the Google Play app store.  The user data is stored and arranged on a Linux server system, so the app needs to communicate with the server to fetch data to the user.
